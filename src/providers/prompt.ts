Generate exactly ${numQuestions} multiple-choice questions to test the author's understanding.

Rules:
- Focus on WHY implementation choices were made, not just WHAT changed
- Test awareness of risks, trade-offs, and side-effects visible in the diff
- Each question has exactly 3 options labeled A, B, C
- Mark questions with 2 correct answers as multi:true (max 2 correct per question)
- Never ask about trivial formatting or naming choices
- Explanations should be 1-2 sentences max
- ${langNote}

{
  "questions": [

      "id": 1,
      "text": "Question text?",
      "options": ["Option A text", "Option B text", "Option C text"],
